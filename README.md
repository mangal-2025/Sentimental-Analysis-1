# VADER Sentimental Analysis of FCA CRM 609
Python program for beginner sentiment analysis
# 🐍 Python Excel Sentiment Analysis Project

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains a simple, yet effective, Python script that performs **Sentiment Analysis** on text data read directly from an Excel spreadsheet. 

It utilizes the popular **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** model from the **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** library to determine the emotional tone (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) of each entry.

The workflow is straightforward:
1. **Input:** Reads data from `CRM_v2.xlsx`.
2. **Analysis:** Runs the sentiment model on the designated text column.
3. **Output:** Saves the original data along with new sentiment scores and labels to `feedback_analyzed.xlsx`.

### **Execution Steps**
**Place the files**: Ensure both excel_analyzer.py and your input file (e.g., feedback.xlsx) are in the same folder.

**Verify the Column**: Crucially, make sure the TEXT_COLUMN variable inside the excel_analyzer.py script matches the name of the column in your Excel file that contains the reviews (e.g., 'Review_Text').

**Run the script**: Open your Terminal, navigate to the project folder using the cd command, and execute the script:

Bash

python3 excel_analyzer.py

**Check Results**: A new file named feedback_analyzed.xlsx will be created in the same folder, containing the results.

## 📂 Repository Contents

| File Name | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `excel_analyzer.py` | The main Python script (algorithm) that handles the data reading, analysis, and writing. |
| `CRM_v2.xlsx` | **Input Data:** The sample Excel file containing the raw text reviews for analysis. |
| `feedback_analyzed.xlsx` | **Output Data:** The Excel file generated by the script, which includes the original data plus the new sentiment scores. |

## 🚀 How to Run the Analysis

### Prerequisites

To run this script on your local machine (Mac, Windows, or Linux), you must have **Python 3** installed.


📈 **Visualization: Generating the Sentiment Chart**
After the analysis script (excel_analyzer.py) runs and generates the output file, you can use Python to create a clear visual representation of the sentiment distribution.

**Prerequisites for Charting**
In addition to the libraries already installed, you need Matplotlib to generate the charts:

pip install matplotlib

You also need the following Python libraries. Install them via your Terminal or Command Prompt:

pip install pandas nltk openpyxl

🖼️ **Chart Generation Steps**
You can integrate the chart generation code directly into the end of your excel_analyzer.py script, or run it separately.

Code Snippet: Use the Plot_Chart.py Python code to read the  Excel file and create the chart. This code counts the labels in the Sentiment_Label column and generates a Pie Chart.
